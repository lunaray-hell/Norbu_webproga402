                  Riki was struggling. Sure, he had other members who was older than him to rely on. But neither of
                  them reached out for him, they never cared. He is only a teenager, what is there to stress about. He
                  didn't have the responsibility of being the eldest or being the leader, but he was still struggling
                  deep inside. He needed help, he was drowning with the endless self doubt he had for himself but he
                  kept everything to himself, he didn't want to burden the others, they had their own issues.


                  “Hyung? I’m not sure if I’m getting the dance correctly, can you practice with me?” Riki asked Heeseung
                   for help.

                  “Riki, I’m tired. Can you ask someone else?” Riki swore he saw Heeseung rolled his eyes.

                  ‘He’s annoyed with you. You made him angry, that’s why he rolled his eyes’

                  Riki didn’t ask for anyone else for help, he didn’t want to anger the others as well. So he stayed
                  alone, practiced alone. As always. He danced and danced until he couldn’t. He checked the
                  time. 1.05 a.m. He have been dancing for 4 hours alone, yet no one cared. He was fine. He didn’t
                  wanted to go back but he knew it would be irresponsible of him.
                  When he reached the dorm, it was 2 o’clock. He opened the door. As expected, Jungwon was
                  waiting. He was angry. He folded his arms while glaring at Riki. “Where were you? Do you know
                  how worried we all are!” Jungwon reprimanded. Riki held in a scoff. He hung his head low,
                  mumbled a apology so that he could go to sleep. “ You better not do this again!” He continued.

                  ‘You made Jungwon mad, he probably tired but had to stay up for you. Why can’t you
                  be more considerate? Why are you so useless’ The voices was loud. It made Riki even more down.

                  After changing out of his sweaty clothes, he went to bed; crying himself to sleep. ‘You’re the
                  youngest, why can’t you be more useful?’ The voices kept on being louder making it harder for
                  Riki to sleep. When he finally got to sleep, he was woken up by Jungwon. Riki didn’t have the
                  strength to listen to the voices, he wanted to sleep. He was so tired. He still woke up, keeping
                  quiet, not wanting to annoy Jungwon anymore, not after what happened during midnight.

                  Riki sat next to Sunoo, the sunshine of the group, for breakfast. Sunoo cracked up a joke, trying to
                  make the maknae happy. But frowned when Riki faked a laugh. Riki didn’t find the joke funny.

                  You’re so useless. You made Sunoo upset. You’re so stupid.’ Riki started tearing up,
                  quickly wiping it away but someone saw him.

                  “Riki? Are you crying?” Jake asked. ‘How did he notice? I was being so discreet.’ “Hm? No i
                  didn’t Hyung? I just yawned.” That seemed like a good reason. Sunoo and Jake didn’t buy it,
                  Sunoo didn’t see Riki yawned, Jake just didn’t believe him, but they didn’t want to push him more.

                  ‘Act happy, so they won’t be suspicious of you.’

                   Riki tried to act happy, so the other two won’t be suspicious. “Alright, hurry up guys! We gotta go
                   to practice.” Riki heard Jungwon. Riki didn’t bother showering, he knew he was going to sweat, so
                   he changed into something clean and suitable for dancing.

                   While dancing, Riki’s movements were sloppy, it looked like he didn’t try but he did. The
                   members were annoyed, he was pulling them back. “Riki! What’s wrong with you today? Why
                   aren’t you trying at all?” Jay scolded.
