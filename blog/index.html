                  Riki was struggling. Sure, he had other members who was older than him to rely on. But neither of
                  them reached out for him, they never cared. He is only a teenager, what is there to stress about. He
                  didn't have the responsibility of being the eldest or being the leader, but he was still struggling
                  deep inside. He needed help, he was drowning with the endless self doubt he had for himself but he
                  kept everything to himself, he didn't want to burden the others, they had their own issues.

          Jay sighs, he knew, he saw it coming but he never thought Sunghoon could be this
          composed while saying that. Jay doesn’t know if he’s in pain, he just felt nothing but a
          landslide of thoughts in his brain.But Jay still ponders why, why it happened. Where did all the good things go? Where did it start to
          crumble? Coughing as he opened the window to his new space, was it a good thing that he did
          submit his resignation a week ago? Maybe it was, maybe it was also a sign of the universe. Jay
          Needed a fresh start in life.
