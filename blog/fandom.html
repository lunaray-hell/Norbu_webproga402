    “Let’s stop this”

    Jay sighs, he knew, he saw it coming but he never thought Sunghoon could be this
    composed while saying that. Jay doesn’t know if he’s in pain, he just felt nothing but a
    landslide of thoughts in his brain.

    “Okay,” okay.

    Notes

    See the end of the work for notes
    Jay was spacing out as he was sitting on their unit’s sofa. Alone as he waits for his partner to go
    home from work.

    ‘In all time, why now?’

    Jay quickly inserts the thing that he’s holding when he hears someone punching the code for their
    unit in his pocket. Cold shivers run down his spine most especially when he remembers that
    Sunghoon told him earlier that they need to talk– about their relationship.

    Jay already knew he would either break down or cry. So in all time, why now? In all the changes
    that they had, why now? Why in this situation?

    “Jay–”
    ‘It’s now Jay– not Jongseong.’
    “Sunghoon,”

    Silence rules the whole area as Jay and Sunghoon were sitting opposite each other, both wearing
    something casual for outside but one holds the greatest secret and one is holding a painful word
    that needed to be said.

    "Let’s stop this,”

    Jay sighs, he knew, he saw it coming but he never thought Sunghoon could be this composed while
    saying that. Jay doesn’t know if he’s in pain, he just felt nothing but a landslide of thoughts in his
    brain.

    “Okay,” okay.

    It wasn’t that easy– it will never be that easy. It's okay but Jay thinks it will never be just fine, it’s
    unfair on how the other side of this relationship cut the ropes that are connecting them alone
    without consulting– without the preparation of letting go. It will always be unfair for Jay.

    Okay. Because Jay believes that love shouldn't come with force, that love should be happy from all
    angles, that yes, love and pain come together but maybe– maybe love left them and let pain handle
    their relationship alone.

    Okay because no matter how much Jay will argue– Sunghoon will always finds his way out of this
    relationship because Jay is weak, Jay’s weak when it comes to Sunghoon’s freedom. Because Jay
    knew once Sunghoon uttered ‘please’ he will just say yes.

    So cutting the chase and the pain short, he said. “Okay,”

    “Okay…” Sunghoon stilled as he watched his former lover, his former home, his former resting
    place, walk away towards their room– towards the room that witnessed their start, their beginning
    only to see them falling apart.

    Sunghoon leaves the unit about quarter to seven– an urgent matter comes up in their office, and
    Sunghoon without realizing it– bids his goodbye to Jay and places a kiss on the latter’s cheek, just
    as he usually does before leaving.
    
    If only Jay’s heart had its own eyes, it will all be swollen. Sunghoon doesn’t even notice that he
    kissed Jay– but the latter’s thanks to the universe for that, out of mannerism or out of impulses, Jay
    thanked the whole world for that, for a simple kiss– even if it means goodbye.
